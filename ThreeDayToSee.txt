1:All of us have read thrilling stories in which the
2:hero had only a limited and specified time to live
3:. Sometimes it was as long as a year; sometimes as
4:short as twenty-four hours. But always we were int
5:erested in discovering just how the doomed man cho
6:se to spend his last days or his last hours. I spe
7:ak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not 
8:condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is 
9:strictly delimited.                              
10:Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we sh
11:ould do under similar circumstances. What events, 
12:what experiences, what associations should we crow
13:d into those last hours as mortal beings? What hap
14:piness should we find in reviewing the past, what 
15:regrets?                                         
16:In stories the doomed hero is usually saved at the
17:last minute by some stroke of fortune, but almost 
18:always his sense of values is changed. he becomes 
19:more appreciative of the meaning of life and its p
20:ermanent spiritual values. It ahs often been noted
21:that those who live, or have lived, in the shadow 
22:of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything th
23:ey do.                                           
24:Most of us, however, take life for granted. We kno
25:w that one day we must die, but usually we picture
26:that day as far in the future. When we are in buoy
27:ant health, death is all but unimaginable. We seld
28:om think of it. The days stretch out in an endless
29:vista. So we go about our petty tasks, hardly awar
30:e of our listless attitude toward life.          
31:The same lethargy, I am afraid, characterizes the 
32:use of all our faculties and senses. Only the deaf
33:appreciate hearing, only the blind realize the man
34:ifold blessings that lie in sight. Particularly do
35:es this observation apply to those who have lost s
36:ight and hearing in adult life. But those who have
37:never suffered impairment of sight or hearing seld
38:om make the fullest use of these blessed faculties
39:. Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sound
40:s hazily, without concentration and with little ap
41:preciation. It is the same old story of not being 
42:grateful for what we have until we lose it, of not
43:being conscious of health until we are ill.      
44:I have often thought it would be a blessing if eac
45:h human being were stricken blind and deaf for a f
46:ew days at some time during his early adult life. 
47:Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight
48:; silence would tech him the joys of sound.      
49:Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to di
50:scover what they see. Recently I was visited by a 
51:very good friends who had just returned from a lo
52:ng walk in the woods, and I asked her what she ha
53:d observed.. “Nothing in particular, “ she replied
54:. I might have been incredulous had I not been acc
55:ustomed to such reposes, for long ago I became con
56:vinced that the seeing see little.
